-network clustering
--k-algorithim
--a type 2 optimization problem, it tries to maximize cohesiveness or minimize distance, 
and it ensures that there are at most k clusters
--type 2 k-center clustering prolbems are generally NP-hard
-center based clustering, one type is k-means clustering
-given a nmber of clusters k, find k clusters
-cluster centers are the mean of all points in the cluster
-to do this 4 points are picked, and all the pints in the network are measured against
these ndoes
-then the means are taken of these subnetworks
-given a number of clusters k, partition the nodes of a graph G(ve) into at most k clusters
such that the largest distance from any node to its cluster center is minimized
G may be weighted.
-given a complete graph G=(V,E) with edge weights for every pair of nodes find a subset 
of at most k vertices S that minimizes w(s) = maxnode min vert Wuv
-this means compute the minimum weight for each node and then find the maximum of all of
those values
-so k-center clustering
--has 3 important subroutines
--a maximal independent set is the first one.
--and independent set of a graph is a set of nodes if no pari of nodes share an edge in the induced subgraph of i on g
-an independent set I is maximal if there are no additional nodes in v that could be added 
and still be an indpenedent set
-greedy maximal independent set algorithim
--initialize a list
--while nodes is not empty:
--pick a vertex and ignore its neighbors
-the bottleneck graph for a weighted graph G and a number c is a subgraph of all edges of
the given value or lower
-the keth power of a graphh is a graph where edges contain edges such that the distance is at most k
-the algorithim takes as an input the sorted edges aas well as the dictionary
-check weights in increadsing order for each one the bottleneck
-this works because the gfeedy max set. 

-dispostions as a function
-input situation, output action and feeling
=put them in a situation where viture is elicited, then they will act in a virtue relevant way
=psychological data and the dime example of people as 
-virtue or good action as something that can be taught
-how a subject percieves a situation could be important to this idea
